## Introduction 

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 20px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 20px"></div><br>

The main aim is predicting breast cancer patients chance of survival.  

- [Clean the data](#5)
- [Augment the data](#7)
- [Create some plots](#10)
- Statistical analysis
- Create the prediction tool


# Materials and methods
## Materials

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 40px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 40px"></div><br>

We are working with a dataset about Breast Cancer that we have obtained from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/)

This is the dataset we are working with:


```{r dataset}
clean_augmented_data <- readRDS(file = "/cloud/project/data/03_clean_augmented_combined_breastcancer_data.rds")

summary(clean_augmented_data)
```


## Cleaning the data

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 60px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 60px"></div><br>

```{r}
clean_augmented_data %>%
  select(weight, age) %>%
  filter(age<20) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red")
```


## Cleaning the data

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 80px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 80px"></div><br>

```{r}
x <- data.frame(BEFORE = c("THE COLUMNS ARE DIFFERENT TYPES","0, 1, 2 VALUES", "NAMES WITH /R/N", "BIRTH DATE WITH 3 CHARACTERS", "BLOOD TYPE 44", "WEIRD WEIGHT/AGE CORRELATIONS", "WOMEN AND MEN"), AFTER = c("EACH COLUMN HAS A CORRECT TYPE","BOLEAN VARIABLES", "CLEAN NAMES", "BIRTH DATE WITH 4 CHARACTERS", "CORRECT BLOOD TYPES ONLY", "ELIMINATING PEOPLE UNDER 20 YEARS OLD AND 35 KG", "ONLY WOMEN"))
x %>% 
 kable() %>%
 kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE, font_size = 20) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = TRUE, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
 column_spec(2, width = "20em") %>%
 row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```


## Augmenting the data {#augment}

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 100px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 100px"></div><br>

- We have added more informative columns 
- We have changed the type of the columns

## Statistical analysis 

<div class="up_bar" style="width: 120px"></div><div class="arrow-right" style="margin-left: 120px"></div><br>

We have created some plots in order to fully understand the data and we have done some statistical analysis like MCA analysis. The plots are shown in the following point: "Results"


# Results {#plots}

[//]: #  Cultural variables we don't actually need (education, marital_state)
[//]: #  Variables that affect health (medicines, vicious habits) have a great incidence in breast cancer patients 
[//]: #  Early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after age 55 expose women to hormones longer, raising their risk of getting breast cancer

[//]: #  In the data, most of the people is quite young (under 40)
[//]: #  The treatment age is consistent with the age of the patients
[//]: #  The thickness tumor is the most changing variable

[//]: #  In all the cases, the recovered fraction is the lowest one.
[//]: #  In the radiation history, the patients who have not suffered from radiation have recovered better than the ones that have had radiation.
[//]: #  In most cases, when having taken medicine the recovery is better.
[//]: #  In most cases, when having taking medicine the death is higher (no sense).
[//]: #  Not drinking alcohol or smoking improves recovery.
[//]: #  When taking alcohol and smoking the death is lower (it doesn't make any sense)
[//]: #  These are absolute values, maybe we should calculate some relative values

[//]: #  Above 40 years old, the possibilities for recovering from a breast cancer are higher
[//]: #  The weight is higher in recovered patients
[//]: #  Patients who died weighted very low (around 25 kg)
[//]: #  In addition, other group of persons who died weighted 75 kg
[//]: #  Thickness of tumor is bigger in patients who died

```{r, out.width = "800px", out.height="600px"}

```


[//]: #  When the tumor thickness augments, the medical treatment has more impact

---

```{r, out.width = "800px", out.height="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_heatmap.png")
```


[//]: #  The birth date is totally correlated to the treatment age with negative values
[//]: #  So it is the age, but with positive values
[//]: #  There is no a clear relation between the thickness tumor and the rest of variables

```
</div>


[//]: # Along the years, the patients are treated before
[//]: # Along the years, the education levels are more diverse
[//]: #  The age of first giving birth is more or less consistent along the years
[//]: #  When the age of treatment is reduced, the thickness tumor is more diverse

[//]: # Normal weight of women and explains why we have eliminated women under 20 years old and 35kg (it's not common, but not impossible)

[//]: # There is a gain weight in breast cancer patients, but it is low so we don't take it in consideration
