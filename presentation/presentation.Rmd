## Introduction



# Materials and methods
## Materials {.smaller}
We are working with a dataset about Breast Cancer that we have obtained from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/)

This is the dataset we are working with:



```{r dataset}
clean_augmented_data %>%
  select(patient_id, education_type, id_healthcenter, id_treatment_region)
```


## Cleaning the data {.smaller}
The data showed the following problems:

- Some columns had 3 values (0, 1, 2), but in the dataset description it appears that they should have only two values (0, 1) so we have considered that 1 and 2 are equal to 1
- Some columns had a carriage return we should delete (/r/n)
- There was a birth date with 3 characters instead of 4.
- There was a blood type 44, it doesn't make any sense.

For statistical analysis, we have chosen only **women**. 

## Cleaning the data{.smaller}

```{r}
x <- data.frame(Before = c("0, 1, 2 values", "names with /r/n", "Birth date with 3 characters", "Blood type44"), After = c("bolean variables", "Clean names", "Birth date with 4 characters", "Correct blood types only"))
x %>% 
 kable() %>%
 kable_styling("striped", full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") %>%
 column_spec(2, width = "20em") %>%
 row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
 row_spec(1, bold = FALSE) %>%
 row_spec(2, bold = FALSE) %>%
 row_spec(3, bold = FALSE)
```

For statistical analysis, we have chosen only **women**. 


## Augmenting the data {.smaller}

- We have added more informative columns 
- We have changed the type of the columns

## Statistical analysis and plots of the data {.smaller}
