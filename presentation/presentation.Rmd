## Introduction



# Materials and methods
## Materials
We are working with a dataset about Breast Cancer that we have obtained from this website: <https://www.kaggle.com/>

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">This text will appear red and bold</span>




## Cleaning the data
The data showed the following problems:

- Some columns had 3 values (0, 1, 2), but in the dataset description it appears that they should have only two values (0, 1) so we have considered that 1 and 2 are equal to 1
- Some columns had a carriage return we should delete (/r/n)
- There was a birth date with 3 characters instead of 4.
- There was a blood type 44, it doesn't make any sense.

For statistical analysis, we have chosen only woman. 

## Augmenting the data

- We have added more columns to improve the information
- We have changed the type of the columns

## Statistical analysis and plots of the data

```{r, fig.cap="Heat map, correlation of numeric variables", out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("04_2_heatmap.png")
```
