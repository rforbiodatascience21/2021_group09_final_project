#Ideas for the project
#We can merge some tables by the sample or by the OTU
#We can see which ones are the most and less prevalent domains, phylum, class...
#In each sample which is the most abundant microorganism
# and the most affected parameters? Are these parameters
#related to these micrroganisms always?
#Which is the country with most variety of micrroganisms?
#Is COD related to an especific factor? In NH4 related to pH?
#Statistical analysis of the samples (linear regression, p-values...)
#We can pivot a table according to the name of the samples (indicates the country)
